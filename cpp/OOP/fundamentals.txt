Rather than being focused on writing functions, we’re focused on defining objects 
that have a well-defined set of behaviors. This is why the paradigm is called “object-oriented”.

e.g., you.driveTo(work); instead of driveTo(you, work);


This allows programs to be written in a more modular fashion, which makes them easier to write 
and understand, and also provides a higher degree of code-reusability.

Note that OOP doesn’t replace traditional programming methods. Rather, it gives you additional 
tools in your programming tool belt to manage complexity when needed.

Object-oriented programming also brings several other useful concepts to the table: 
inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism
